Installation
============

Before studying systems with SwarmRL, it is important to have installed the package.
In this section, we will go over how to install SwarmRL in its most basic form.


From source
-----------
Currently SwamrRL is only available from source so it must be installed within the local directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/SwarmRL/SwarmRL.git
   cd SwarmRL
   pip install .


We currently support **Python ?? only**. Users on older interpreter versions
are urged to upgrade.

After running these commands, SwarmRl will be available as a Python package and can be
used in any Python script with:

.. code-block:: python

   import swarmrl
