Welcome to SwarmRL documentation!
=================================

**SwarmRL** is a Python package designed for the efficient control of micro-robots. 
Its primary aim is to make advanced micro-robot control tools more accessible and user-friendly. 
SwarmRL offers an intuitive interface for developing models that control microscopic colloids using 
both classical control methods and deep actor-critic reinforcement learning approaches.

Key Features of SwarmRL
-----------------------

SwarmRL is equipped with a range of features that facilitate micro-robot control:

* **Integration with EspressoMD**: Ensures compatibility with the EspressoMD simulation engine for effective modeling and simulation.
* **Support for Experimental Setups**: Provides functionalities essential for various experimental scenarios in the field of micro-robotics.
* **Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning**: Incorporates sophisticated learning strategies, particularly useful in multi-agent systems.

Comprehensive Framework
-----------------------

SwarmRL serves as a versatile framework for both the development and evaluation of reinforcement 
learning and mathematical optimization algorithms. It is well-suited for managing single-agent 
systems as well as complex multi-agent environments, providing essential tools for research and development in micro-robotics.
